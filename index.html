    <br>Click the button to generate a new number for the 2 die sets. This is the 4-5-6 game and if you get a roll of 4-5-6, you win. </br>
    <br>If the numbers are not in that combination, reroll again. If you get a roll of 1-2-3, you lose. There are trips and points with trips being higher than points.</br> 
    <br>The person with the highest roll wins. Disclaimer: The game does not count points. </br>
