# 4-5-6 Dice-game
Coded in p5.js (basically processing + javascript)

Disclaimer: This game is not meant to encourage gambling and this game is not intended to be used for it. 

Requirements: the p5.js library be installed onto your text editor or IDE (Codepen or the p5.js web editor). If you want it to run a website, you need the script tag for p5.js and all the other p5.js libraries you're using 

Recommendations: I would use Codepen for this as they have the p5.js library on there. In order to have it on Codepen, go to settings on your pen, go to Add External Scripts/Pens and type in p5.js into the Search CDNjs text field. From there you click p5.js and click save & close. You should have a white screen that pops up and you can now code in p5.js.
I would also recommend to look in the p5.js reference to search for what you are looking for such as mouseIsPressed(), ellipse(), or KeyPressed().
